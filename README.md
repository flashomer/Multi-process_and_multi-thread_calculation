#Multi-process_and_multi-thread_calculation

**Implement three programs**
a) mad_sequential.c ; Basic program
b) mad_process.c ; Program with 2 processes
c) mad_threads.c ; Program with 2,3,4 threads according to the parameter
For process communications you should handle inter-process communication (IPC) between processes by yourself. Please pay an extra attention for communication part which is the most important portion for (b) part.
For multithreaded program you need to take necessary precautions for data consistency for the shared variables in your project if it is necessary.
